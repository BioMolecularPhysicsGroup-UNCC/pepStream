Soon:
Automatic generation of target (this is halfway there)

There is a bug in fragSO.py - seems to always make a fasta file for cMoRF even if the length req. isnt met
				I think this is a simple logic issue, would be helpful for Filter steps

All files should be copied from this dir (like how we run DCM) this would need to be implemented across all scripts

relative names for all loops or processes using other files (e.g. listOfNames=(../../zDockModels/specificModels/*Model*_m.pdb)

clean up the code from all the old segment junk (dont delete comments plz, should be obvious what is english and what is not)

Future:
Replace iTasser with something that runs on gpu (AF2, RF, OmegaFold, whatever)
Replace zDock (wont be supported anymore) - I suggest megadock (runs on gpu)

Subsample the mutated sequences in some logical fashion - the distribution of values (entropy) can be interpolated?
	Could be possible to skip all this using a LM (ESM would be my first bet, progen maybe)
